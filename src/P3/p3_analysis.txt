In this testbench, constraints were added to only generate valid opcodes and to the values of a and b based on the opcode. The opcode generation is reflected in the covergroup window screenshot. The distribution constraint is shown in the number of generated opcodes and subsequently in the number of values for a and b (for example, more vales in the range 0-50 were generated because the addition operation was performed more often).
